# Quiz-application-using-c-
I’m thrilled to share my latest project: a quiz application developed using C++! This app not only tests knowledge but also keeps score, awarding 5 points for each correct answer and 0 for incorrect ones. It’s a fun way to enhance my programming skills while creating an interactive learning tool.
